myTV RSS Scraper

myTV is a script that will scrape your favorites rss feed from supported
TV Listing websites.  Currently supported are tvtorrents.com
(http://www.tvtorrents.com) and showRSS(http://showrss.karmorra.info/).
The script will submit new links to transmission-daemon.  It includes regex
filters, basic torrent management, twitter notification of completed torrents
and rss history.

The author of this script has NO AFFILIATION WHATSOEVER with the administrators

UPGRADING
===============

If you are upgrading from a previous release, there is no fancy way to migrate
your current history file, so don't bother.  Please follow the install
directions.  Filters from tvtrss >= 0.0.4 can be copied directly to the new
mytv.conf file, as the filter structure has not changed.

INSTALL
===============

This softweare relies on the current version of transmission-cli.  As of this
writing, the current version is 1.76.  Install transmission-cli and edit the
rpc user and password.  Also make sure to whitelist the system frojm which
myTV will be connecting by adding the appropriate IP address to the
rpc-whitelist line.

FYI, transmission-daemon will overwrite the settings.json file on exit, so you
will need to stop transmission-daemn before modifying this file.

This software also relies on the following perl modules which are typically not
included in a default perl environment:
 XML::RSSLite
 Net::Twitter
 
They can be downloaded from cpan.org.  If you are using Ubuntu (9.10),
you can get them by installing the following packages via apt-get:
 libxml-rsslite-perl
 libnet-twitter-perl

For fedora/redhat users, grab the perl-XML-RSSLite package from the DAG repo.
If you have no idea what I'm talking about, then Google is your friend.
The Net::Twitter perl package is not available at the Dag repository.  Download
and install from CPAN.

First determine the user who will be running the script.  I'm assuming here
that it will be the root user.  If it is another user, you will need to chown
the /var/cache/mytv directory to the appropriate uid, and edit the cron entry
so that the cron job runs as the appropriate user.

Installation is simple.  Perform the following actions as root ...
1. cp mytv.conf /etc/mytv.conf
2. mkdir -p /var/cache/mytv
3. chown user.group -R /var/cache/mytv (if required)
4. cp mytv /usr/sbin
5. cp mytv.cron /etc/cron.d/mytv
6. /etc/init.d/cron restart
7. Add your favorites RSS feed to /etc/mytv.conf
8. Add your transmission-daemon credentials to /etc/mytv.conf

CONFIGURATION
===============

The config file, by default, must be located at /etc/mytv.conf.  The comments
in the config file are pretty self-explanatory.  The filters are perl regular
expressions.  The sample filters supplied should give you enough of a start to
get what you are looking for.  Filters are NOT case sensative.  If you wish to
load an alternative configuratiuon file at runtime, use the -c option ...

  mytv -c /path/to/config

This will load an alternative configuration file.  This can be useful for
debugging with the -d option.  Using the debug option will allow you to test
the filters and other configuration functionality, but no files will be
altered, and no torrents will be submitted.

FILTERS
===============

The filtering system is a First Match basis.  This is the best method for
filtering shows where you wish to retrieve a Hi-Def version of only certain
shows.

The order of the filters in the configuration file is the order in which the
filter processor will process the show titles.  Filters prefixed with a + are
"Match and Accept", while filters prefixed with - are "Match and Reject".
The configuration file contains some starter filters.

Attached to the filter is the destination for the completed torrent ...
+Californication::/path/to/destination

If no destination exists for a filter, then the default destination will be
used, which is one defined by the defaultDestination configuration option.
Lastly, be sure that the user which transmission-daemon is running as has
the permission to write to the destination directories.  Transmission-daemon
will pause your torrent in the event that it can not be moved.
